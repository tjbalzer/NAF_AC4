# Lab 01 - A multipfication agent with FastMCP
This lab will guide you through creating a simple multiplication agent using the FastMCP framework. The agent will take two numbers as input and return their product.

## Run the server
First, ensure that your FastMCP server is running. You can start the server by executing
the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 server.py
``` 

Check the results - the server is up and running 

You can close this as our client will spawn a server as part of its process.

Control-C to stop the server if you started it manually.

## Run the client 

Now run the client to interact with the multiplication agent. Execute the following command in a new terminal window:

```bash
python3 agent.py
```

You should see the client discover the server and now you can send two numbers to multiply.
